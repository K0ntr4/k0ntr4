### About me

Hey, I’m Luca, a passionate computer science graduate and software developer from Germany. I’ve been programming with enthusiasm as a hobby since school and started my studies in 2021 after graduating.

I began my dual studies in April 2022 at a fintech startup, where I worked mainly as an AQA (Automation Quality Assurance) Engineer until June 2024, gaining over two years of hands-on experience in a fast-paced startup environment.

Since June 2024, I’ve been working at a mid-sized company in Berlin, where I initially joined through my dual studies and now work full-time as a developer. I completed my studies by submitting my bachelor’s thesis in October 2025 and am no longer enrolled.

Alongside my studies and early career, I also worked as a freelance developer on Fiverr, achieving Seller Level 2. I eventually stopped freelancing, as balancing it with my dual studies and professional work became too demanding.

### My Skills

- **Programming:** My main focus is currently on Python, C# and Java. I also have experience with C, C++, Golang, Dart, Haskell, Pascal, JavaScript, and HTML.
- **Paradigms:** I enjoy working procedurally and have extensive experience with object-oriented programming.
- **Experience:** My background as an AQA Engineer, full-time developer, and former freelancer has given me practical skills in automated testing, backend development, code reviews, and implementing tailored software solutions.

### What I do

- **Work:** I currently work full-time as a software developer at a mid-sized company in Berlin. Previously, I spent over two years at a fintech startup, where I worked mainly as an Automation Quality Assurance (AQA) Engineer, focusing on automated testing and software quality.
- **Freelancing:** I gained practical experience offering programming services as a Seller Level 2 on Fiverr. I decided to stop freelancing to focus on my studies and full-time professional work.
- **Projects & Experience:** Through my professional roles and personal projects, I have gained hands-on experience in software development, automated testing, desktop automations, code reviews, and building customized software solutions.

### What drives me

I'm always on the lookout for new challenges and technologies to learn and master. 
My passion for computer science drives me to constantly expand my knowledge and work on innovative solutions.

### Projects

Here are some interesting projects I am currently working on in my free time:

#### Pokemon Battle Advisor

The [Pokemon Battle Advisor](https://github.com/K0ntr4/pokemonBattleAdvisor) is a tool designed to help you make better decisions during battles. It provides insights and recommendations based on your party members and the enemy Pokemon you're facing.

#### Anime Game Character Fusion Generator

The [Anime Game Character Fusion Generator](https://github.com/K0ntr4/anigame_fusion) is a fun and creative side project designed to blend elements of anime characters with specific game themes, producing unique and visually appealing images. Leveraging the power of the `cagliostrolab/animagine-xl-3.1` library for anime character generation and the `igdb` (Internet Game Database) API for accessing game data, this project offers users the ability to generate personalized profile pictures that reflect their favorite anime and gaming interests.


### Hobbies

When I'm not coding (which is also a hobby for me), you can often find me:

- **Gaming**: I enjoy exploring virtual worlds and competing in multiplayer games.  
- **Gym**: I'm passionate about fitness and regularly hit the gym to stay active and healthy.  
- **Meeting Friends**: Spending time with friends is important to me,
whether it's grabbing a hot chocolate, going to events, or simply hanging out and catching up.

These activities help me stay balanced and refreshed, ready to tackle new coding challenges with enthusiasm!

### Fun Fact

Despite being a developer, I don't drink coffee! Instead, you'll often find me enjoying a hot chocolate while coding.
