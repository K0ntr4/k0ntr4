### About me

Hey, I'm Luca, a passionate computer science student and software developer from Germany. I've been programming with enthusiasm for over seven years and started my studies three years ago. Currently, I've been working for two and a half years at an exciting fintech startup as part of my dual studies. On the side, I've also worked as a freelancer on Fiverr and have risen to Seller Level 2.

### My Skills

**Programming:** My main focus is currently on Python, but I also have experience with C, C++, Golang, Haskell, Pascal, Java, JavaScript, and HTML.  
**Paradigms:** I enjoy working procedurally and have extensive experience in object-oriented programming.  
**[Experience](https://share.k0ntr4.de/share/my_cv):** Through my work in the fintech startup, freelancing on Fiverr, and personal projects, I have practical experience in implementing customized programming projects, desktop automations, and code reviews.

**Work:** In my job at the fintech startup, I work on exciting projects shaping the future of financial technology.  
**Freelancing:** As a Seller Level 2 on Fiverr, I've offered my programming services and completed a variety of client projects.

### What drives me

I'm always on the lookout for new challenges and technologies to learn and master. 
My passion for computer science drives me to constantly expand my knowledge and work on innovative solutions.

### Projects

Here are some interesting projects I am currently working on in my free time:

#### Pokemon Battle Advisor

The [Pokemon Battle Advisor](https://github.com/K0ntr4/pokemonBattleAdvisor) is a tool designed to help you make better decisions during battles. It provides insights and recommendations based on your party members and the enemy Pokemon you're facing.

#### Anime Game Character Fusion Generator

The [Anime Game Character Fusion Generator](https://github.com/K0ntr4/anigame_fusion) is a fun and creative side project designed to blend elements of anime characters with specific game themes, producing unique and visually appealing images. Leveraging the power of the `cagliostrolab/animagine-xl-3.1` library for anime character generation and the `igdb` (Internet Game Database) API for accessing game data, this project offers users the ability to generate personalized profile pictures that reflect their favorite anime and gaming interests.


### Hobbies

When I'm not coding (which is also a hobby for me), you can often find me:

**Gaming**: I enjoy exploring virtual worlds and competing in multiplayer games.  
**Gym**: I'm passionate about fitness and regularly hit the gym to stay active and healthy.  
**Meeting Friends**: Spending time with friends is important to me,
whether it's grabbing a hot chocolate, going to events, or simply hanging out and catching up.

These activities help me stay balanced and refreshed, ready to tackle new coding challenges with enthusiasm!

### Fun Fact

Despite being a developer, I don't drink coffee! Instead, you'll often find me enjoying a hot chocolate while coding.
